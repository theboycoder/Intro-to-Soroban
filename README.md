<h2>Preface</h2>
<h3>Smart contracts</h3>

Smart contracts have been the key foundation to many of the most innovative and disruptive developments in the blockchain space. From decentralized finance(DeFi) to asset issuance, smart contracts have enabled new ways of doing business and opened up many exciting opportunities for growth and innovation. They have helped increase the speed, efficiency, and security of transactions, making it possible for businesses and individuals to conduct complex and high value transactions on the blockchain with confidence. As the capabilities of smart contracts continue to evolve and expand, they will continue to play a  important role in driving innovation and enabling new possibilities.

# What is Soroban?

Soroban is a new generation smart contract language that is being developed by the Stellar Development Foundation. It is designed to address some of the challenges and limitations of existing smart contract platforms. Soroban is designed to be more efficient, secure, user-friendly and scalable than other smart conrtact platforms. It is intended to be used on the Stellar blockchain, but it is not limited to Stellar and could potentially be used on other blockchain networks, L2s and permissioned ledgers as well.

Soroban is built on Rust and WASM, It allows fast, scalable and sensible smart contracts to be developed. They offer high level proformance and efficency, and run quickly and efficently without sacrificing security or reliability. Soroban leverages the powerful Rust & WASM tech stakck, and enables developers to create high performance, safe, secure, and scable dApps.
